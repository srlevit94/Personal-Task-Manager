## Description

Personal Task Manager allows users to create projects, track the work they've already done, and organize future tasks. It also records the amount of time users have spent on each project, which is easily accessible on each project page, as well as on a bar graph that provides a visual representation of the work they've completed thus far. There is even a space for "break time" where users will be able to access external videos and sites to relax their mind after all that busy work!
